# OpenCL-comparison
Measures of different kinds of research using OpenCL

The purpose of this project was to compare the efficacity of GPGPU with classics sequential research on CPU through several examples.
For each example a sequential implementation, and a GPGPU one is present. The examples are the followings:

1. Find the max value and position of an integer in a vector.
2. Find the min value and position of an integer in a vector.
3. Position of an integer in a one dimension vector.
4. Position (x, y) of an integer in a matrix.
5. Position of n integers in a matrix.
6. Most present integer in a matrix.
